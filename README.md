# üìä RFM Analysis and K-Means Clustering Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook documents the complete analytical process for the **E-commerce Customer Segmentation Dashboard**. It serves as the **technical backbone** for the live Streamlit application, detailing the methodology used to transform raw transaction data into actionable customer segments.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this analysis was to move beyond simple cohort analysis and use unsupervised machine learning to group customers based on their purchasing behavior.

### Methodology Pipeline:
1.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, filtering out returns, and addressing invalid entries.
2.  **RFM Feature Engineering:** Calculating the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value for each unique customer ID.
3.  **Data Scaling:** Applying **Log Transformation** and **Standard Scaling** to ensure the RFM features are normally distributed and weighted equally for the K-Means algorithm.
4.  **Optimal Cluster Determination:** Using the **Elbow Method** to confirm the optimal number of clusters ($k=3$).
5.  **K-Means Clustering:** Applying the K-Means algorithm to assign a unique cluster label to every customer.
6.  **Segment Profiling:** Interpreting the clusters based on their mean RFM scores and assigning the final business names: **Best Customers**, **Growing Customers**, and **Hibernating Customers**.
